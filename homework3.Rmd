#### Due: 2/17/2022 before 11:59pm. Submit in Canvas (file upload).

1. Finish the in-class practice in Slides 3-12 in "Lecture 2-2-Practice for git", link: https://yumouqiu.github.io/DS202-Spring2023/Practice/practice01.html  
    a. Download the RMarkdown file with these homework instructions to use as a template for your work. Make sure to replace "Your Name" with your name.  
    b. In the RMarkdown file, write down table of team members, and their github repository links;   
the number of successful pull requests you made, and the github repository to which you requested a change;  
the number of pull requests you accepted, and the github repository from which you accepted.  
    c. Write down a list with at least 3 tips of how to make working with git/github easier  

2. Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada (fixed data) and Australia by RMarkdown based on the data set "gapminder-5060", like what we did in the class.  
Please use Github to collaborate on this problem. For example, one member can create the plot of US in his/her repository. The other member will fork this repository, add the result for the second country, and make a pull request for merging into the main repository. Each member should at least analyze one country and make at least one pull request. **Please submit the RMarkdown file, the output file, and the screen shot of the successful pull request and the merge.**

3. Write a paragraph (~200 words) describing an example of what you consider data science. Write your paragraph in R Markdown. Include at least 
    a. one link to a chart or an image and 
    b. at least one itemized or enumerated list.
    

Note: your submission is supposed to be fully reproducible, i.e. the TA and I will 'knit' your submission in RStudio. Including the link to the image is the tricky part here. Make sure that you don't use any file structure that depends on your computing environment.


For the submission: submit your solution in an **R Markdown file** and (just for insurance) submit the corresponding html (or Word) file with it. 

#### Part 1
Team members:
```{r}
team_member <- matrix(c("Xuan Wen Loo", 'https://github.com/xuanwenloo/practice1-xuanwenloo', "Roy Khoo", 'https://github.com/roy-kcj/practice-roy-kcj'), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(team_member) <- c('Name','Github repository link')
rownames(team_member) <- c('1','2')
team_member <- as.table(team_member)
team_member
```

I made 1 successful pull request to https://github.com/roy-kcj/practice-roy-kcj.

I accepted 1 pull request in https://github.com/xuanwenloo/practice1-xuanwenloo.


**3 tips of how to make working with git/github easier:**

1. Use branches while adding new features before merging. This can avoid interfering the main code if there was an error.

2. Utilize pull request to collaborate with others and keep track of changes.

3. Write clear commit message to help others understand the changes.


#### Part 2
```{r}
# Read the data
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumouqiu/DS202-Spring2023/main/Lecture1_collaborative-environment/data/gapminder-5060.csv")

# Fix Canada problematic value
data %>% filter(year == 1957, country == 'Canada')
fixed_data <- data %>% mutate(lifeExp = replace(lifeExp, year==1957, 69.96))
canada <- fixed_data %>% filter(country == "Canada")

# Filter United States country and plot LifExp vs. gdpPercap
us <- fixed_data %>% filter(country == "United States")
us %>% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = country)) + geom_line() + geom_line(data = fixed_data %>% filter(country %in% c("Canada", "Australia")))

```


#### Part 3
Instagram advertisement is an example of data science. They involve the use of data and analytics to optimize ad campaigns and target audiences more effectively. When creating an Instagram ad campaign, businesses can use data to define their target audience based on demographics, interests, behavior, and location. They can also track users' engagement with their ads to measure the effectiveness of the campaign. By collecting and analyzing these data, businesses can adjust their ad targeting and content to optimize the campaign and improve their return on investment. Instagram also provides businesses with access to analytics tools that allow them to track their audience's engagement with their content. These tools provide insights into how many people are seeing and interacting with the ad, where they are located, and what actions they are taking. This information can be used to adjust the campaign and improve its effectiveness. Moreover, Instagram also uses machine learning algorithms to display relevant ads to users based on their behavior and preferences. These algorithms analyze user data such as search history, location, and engagement to determine the most relevant and engaging ads for each user. Therefore, Instagram advertising involves the use of data science techniques such as data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning to optimize ad campaigns and improve their effectiveness.
